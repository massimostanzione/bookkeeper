/**
 * {@link EnsemblePlacementPolicy} encapsulates the algorithm that bookkeeper client uses to select a number of bookies
 * from the cluster as an ensemble for storing entries.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The algorithm is typically implemented based on the data input as well as the network topology properties.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * This interface basically covers three parts:
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Initialization and uninitialization&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;How to choose bookies to place data&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;How to choose bookies to do speculative reads&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Initialization and uninitialization&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The ensemble placement policy is constructed by jvm reflection during constructing bookkeeper client.
 * After the {@code EnsemblePlacementPolicy} is constructed, bookkeeper client will call
 * {@link #initialize(ClientConfiguration, Optional, HashedWheelTimer, FeatureProvider, StatsLogger)} to initialize
 * the placement policy.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The {@link #initialize(ClientConfiguration, Optional, HashedWheelTimer, FeatureProvider, StatsLogger)}
 * method takes a few resources from bookkeeper for instantiating itself. These resources include:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;`ClientConfiguration` : The client configuration that used for constructing the bookkeeper client.
 *                             The implementation of the placement policy could obtain its settings from this
 *                             configuration.
 * &lt;li&gt;`DNSToSwitchMapping`: The DNS resolver for the ensemble policy to build the network topology of the bookies
 *                           cluster. It is optional.
 * &lt;li&gt;`HashedWheelTimer`: A hashed wheel timer that could be used for timing related work.
 *                         For example, a stabilize network topology could use it to delay network topology changes to
 *                         reduce impacts of flapping bookie registrations due to zk session expires.
 * &lt;li&gt;`FeatureProvider`: A {@link FeatureProvider} that the policy could use for enabling or disabling its offered
 *                        features. For example, a {@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} could offer features
 *                        to disable placing data to a specific region at runtime.
 * &lt;li&gt;`StatsLogger`: A {@link StatsLogger} for exposing stats.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The ensemble placement policy is a single instance per bookkeeper client. The instance will
 * be {@link #uninitalize()} when closing the bookkeeper client. The implementation of a placement policy should be
 * responsible for releasing all the resources that allocated during
 * {@link #initialize(ClientConfiguration, Optional, HashedWheelTimer, FeatureProvider, StatsLogger)}.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;How to choose bookies to place data&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The bookkeeper client discovers list of bookies from zookeeper via {@code BookieWatcher} - whenever there are
 * bookie changes, the ensemble placement policy will be notified with new list of bookies via
 * {@link #onClusterChanged(Set, Set)}. The implementation of the ensemble placement policy will react on those
 * changes to build new network topology. Subsequent operations like {@link #newEnsemble(int, int, int, Map, Set)} or
 * {@link #replaceBookie(int, int, int, Map, Collection, BookieSocketAddress, Set)} hence can operate on the new
 * network topology.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Both {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} and {@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} are
 * {@link TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}s. They build a {@link org.apache.bookkeeper.net.NetworkTopology} on
 * bookie changes, use it for ensemble placement and ensure {@code rack/region} coverage for write quorums.
 *
 * &lt;h4&gt;Network Topology&lt;/h4&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The network topology is presenting a cluster of bookies in a tree hierarchical structure. For example,
 * a bookie cluster may be consists of many data centers (aka regions) filled with racks of machines.
 * In this tree structure, leaves represent bookies and inner nodes represent switches/routes that manage
 * traffic in/out of regions or racks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For example, there are 3 bookies in region `A`. They are `bk1`, `bk2` and `bk3`. And their network locations are
 * {@code /region-a/rack-1/bk1}, {@code /region-a/rack-1/bk2} and {@code /region-a/rack-2/bk3}. So the network topology
 * will look like below:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      root
 *        |
 *     region-a
 *       /  \
 * rack-1  rack-2
 *   /  \       \
 * bk1  bk2     bk3
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Another example, there are 4 bookies spanning in two regions `A` and `B`. They are `bk1`, `bk2`, `bk3` and `bk4`.
 * And their network locations are {@code /region-a/rack-1/bk1}, {@code /region-a/rack-1/bk2},
 * {@code /region-b/rack-2/bk3} and {@code /region-b/rack-2/bk4}. The network topology will look like below:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *         root
 *         /  \
 * region-a  region-b
 *     |         |
 *   rack-1    rack-2
 *     / \       / \
 *   bk1  bk2  bk3  bk4
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The network location of each bookie is resolved by a {@link DNSToSwitchMapping}. The {@link DNSToSwitchMapping}
 * resolves a list of DNS-names or IP-addresses into a list of network locations. The network location that is returned
 * must be a network path of the form `/region/rack`, where `/` is the root, and `region` is the region id representing
 * the data center where `rack` is located. The network topology of the bookie cluster would determine the number of
 *
 * &lt;h4&gt;RackAware and RegionAware&lt;/h4&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} basically just chooses bookies from different racks in the built
 * network topology. It guarantees that a write quorum will cover at least two racks. It expects the network locations
 * resolved by {@link DNSToSwitchMapping} have at least 2 levels. For example, network location paths like
 * {@code /dc1/rack0} and {@code /dc1/row1/rack0} are okay, but {@link /rack0} is not acceptable.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} is a hierarchical placement policy, which it chooses
 * equal-sized bookies from regions, and within each region it uses {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} to choose
 * bookies from racks. For example, if there is 3 regions - {@code region-a}, {@code region-b} and {@code region-c},
 * an application want to allocate a {@code 15-bookies} ensemble. First, it would figure out there are 3 regions and
 * it should allocate 5 bookies from each region. Second, for each region, it would use
 * {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} to choose &lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; bookies.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Since {@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} is based on {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}, it expects
 * the network locations resolved by {@link DNSToSwitchMapping} have at least &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; levels.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;How to choose bookies to do speculative reads?&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link #reorderReadSequence(ArrayList, List, Map)} and {@link #reorderReadLACSequence(ArrayList, List, Map)} are
 * two methods exposed by the placement policy, to help client determine a better read sequence according to the
 * network topology and the bookie failure history.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For example, in {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}, the reads will be attempted in following sequence:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;bookies are writable and didn't experience failures before
 * &lt;li&gt;bookies are writable and experienced failures before
 * &lt;li&gt;bookies are readonly
 * &lt;li&gt;bookies already disappeared from network topology
 * &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In {@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}, the reads will be tried in similar following sequence
 * as `RackAware` placement policy. There is a slight different on trying writable bookies: after trying every 2
 * bookies from local region, it would try a bookie from remote region. Hence it would achieve low latency even
 * there is network issues within local region.
 *
 * &lt;h2&gt;How to configure the placement policy?&lt;/h2&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Currently there are 3 implementations available by default. They are:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy}&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy}&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;You can configure the ensemble policy by specifying the placement policy class in
 * {@link ClientConfiguration#setEnsemblePlacementPolicy(Class)}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;{@link DefaultEnsemblePlacementPolicy} randomly pickups bookies from the cluster, while both
 * {@link RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} and {@link RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy} choose bookies based on
 * network locations. So you might also consider configuring a proper {@link DNSToSwitchMapping} in
 * {@link BookKeeper.Builder} to resolve the correct network locations for your cluster.
